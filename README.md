<br>Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, or message broker. It is designed to be fast, scalable, and reliable.

<br>At its core, Redis is a key-value store, meaning it stores data in the form of key-value pairs. Each key is associated with a value, and these pairs can be stored, retrieved, and manipulated using various Redis commands.
